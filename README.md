## Bright Events 

This project provides a platform for event organizers to create and manage different types of events while making them easily accessible to target markets.
 
### Challenge statement

This project is broken down into 4 challenges whose completion would contribute greatly to my learning towards becoming a full-stack developer. Upon completion, I would have built a world-class full-stack (frontend and backend) Python and JavaScript events application.

### Usage

The project is entirely for educational purposes with no intention to release it for use by the public. However, in an ideal scenario, it would be used by event organizers as well as attendees  to have a one stop for registration and managing the logistics of an  event/events. Bright events is open to be used in any locality.
