## 🌟 Bright Events 

### 🎉 Introduction

**Bright Events** is a web platform designed for event organizers to effortlessly create and manage a variety of events. Whether it's a birthday bash, a family gathering, or a community festival, Bright Events makes it easy!


### 🌈 The Context

As a busy mom, I often find myself juggling the demands of family life while trying to plan events-be it a birthday party, family-get-together and community events. I realized how challenging it can be to manage RSVPs, schedule activities, and keep track of all the details. This inspired me to build Bright Events.

The journey began with the motivation of building an application on my own from scratch. My goal was to deepen my learning as I pursued my path to becoming a software engineer through the [ALX -Software Engineering Foundations](https://www.alxafrica.com/learn/programming-development/) program.

### 👩‍💻 The Team

### 🛠️ Usage

The project is entirely for educational purposes with no intention to release it for use by the public. However, in an ideal scenario, it would be used by event organizers as well as attendees  to have a one stop for registration and managing the logistics of an  event/events. Bright Events is open to be used in any locality.
